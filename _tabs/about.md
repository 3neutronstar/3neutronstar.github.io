# Minsoo Kang

I am a M.S student in Department of Articial Intelligence at Korea University advised by Professor [SungHwan Lee](http://pr.korea.ac.kr/), and a student researcher in Center for Artificial Intelligence at KIST co-advised by Senior Researcher [Suhyun Kim](https://kdst.re.kr/) . 
I am especially interested in debiasing representation, data augmentation, and data-free continual learning. 
My previous research has been focused on a real-world applicable method by utilizing reinforcement learning.
